## IFrame Host/Client 1.0.0 ##

This is a research app to allow different Single Page Applications (SPA) be able to reside in harmony on a single "window."
The purposed implementation is to create a mock "host/client(s)" network.  Each client SPA will be loaded into the host window as IFrames - a special library has been created to bridge the communication of the SPA client(s) and the host window.
